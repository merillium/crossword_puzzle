### Running the crossword puzzle program
###### You need to have the PyGame library installed.
###### pip3 install pygame

###### Then clone this directory locally and type the following command into terminal:
###### python3 -i main.py

##### Features that need to be added: 
###### (1) "horizontal" and "vertical" headings for the two types clues </br> (2) clues should be bound in a box with wrapping text based on the dimensions of the grid </br> (3) clue font size should adjust automatically to the size of the grid </br> (4) implement a button to check for correctness of the grid (instead of incorrect colors immediately displaying as red) </br> (5) Crossword puzzle grids are currently hard-coded. A webscraper to obtain completed NYT-style crosswords or a crossword generator (very computationally intensive but an interesting problem!) would be a nice feature. 

###### Currently this is what the Pygame console looks like when it loads with a sample grid.
